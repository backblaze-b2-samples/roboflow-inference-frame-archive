## Users

Edge computer-vision teams — manufacturing quality engineers, retail loss-prevention
ops, and the developers/agents building for them — who run detection models at the edge
and need a durable, searchable archive of what the cameras saw. Their context: an edge
"camera" runs detection locally on each frame, and the frames worth keeping (plus their
predictions) must land in cheap, durable object storage they can browse and roll up
later.

## Product Purpose

A B2 sample that demonstrates Backblaze B2 as the single durable sink for a
high-throughput, multi-stream vision pipeline. An edge camera runs **Roboflow
Inference** (`inference`) 100% locally over a source clip; every frame whose top
detection clears the camera's confidence threshold is streamed to B2 as three coupled
artifact streams — the JPEG frame, its prediction JSON, and a per-run Parquet summary.
The app lets an operator configure cameras, run a detection pass, browse the flagged
frames with boxes overlaid, and watch archive-wide metrics on a dashboard — all over
the S3-compatible API, with B2 credentials the only required keys. Success = a builder
can clone it, run a detection pass on the bundled CC-BY demo clip, and see the archive
fill with frames, predictions, and summaries in their own bucket.

## Maturity and Support Boundary

This is a maintained open-source template/sample, not a complete hosted SaaS product.
It is built with production-minded controls and can be adapted for production use with
caution, but adopters own product-specific validation, security, deployment, and
operations. Repository defects and feature requests go through the public GitHub issue
tracker; B2 account, billing, service, and API questions go through Backblaze Support.
The template/sample itself is not covered by the Backblaze service level agreement,
and no SLA is provided for the repository software.

## Brand Personality

Confident, precise, quietly professional. Voice is direct and free of hype ("Stop
wiring boilerplate and start building"). The interface should feel like a modern
developer tool — considered, calm, trustworthy — not a marketing showpiece. It is a
**neutral foundation** that others rebrand: the design carries craft through restraint,
not through a strong opinionated identity of its own.

## Anti-references

- **Generic AI/SaaS slop.** No gradient text, hero-metric templates, identical
  icon-card grids, tracked uppercase eyebrows, or decorative glassmorphism. These are
  the exact 2026 AI tells this kit exists to help builders avoid.
- **Over-branded / loud.** No heavy brand-color drenching, decorative motion, or flashy
  effects. It is scaffolding to be rebranded, not a hero page.
- **Toy / prototype feel.** No missing states, inconsistent components, or placeholder
  polish. Must read as polished, dependable scaffolding.
- **Enterprise-drab.** No Bootstrap-era gray boxes or dense-but-lifeless admin-panel
  look. Considered, like modern dev tools (Linear, GitHub Primer, Stripe).

## Design Principles

- **Practice what you preach.** The kit itself must model the engineering quality it
  asks agents to produce. Slop here propagates into every project built on it.
- **Neutral foundation, easy to rebrand.** Identity lives in tokens (`globals.css`) and
  one config file. Screens are built from the shared UI kit so a rebrand is a token
  swap, not a rewrite.
- **Earned familiarity over novelty.** Use standard, trusted affordances (top bar +
  side nav, command palette, data tables). The tool disappears into the task.
- **Every state is designed.** Default, hover, focus, active, disabled, loading (skeleton),
  empty (teaches the interface), and error (says what's wrong + offers retry) — never
  half-shipped.
- **Consistency is the feature.** One button vocabulary, one form-control set, one icon
  style across every screen. Divergence is a bug.

## Accessibility & Inclusion

Target **WCAG 2.1 AA**. Body text ≥ 4.5:1, large/bold text ≥ 3:1, visible focus
indicators on every interactive element, full keyboard navigation, correct semantic
landmarks and heading order, labelled form controls, and a `prefers-reduced-motion`
alternative for every animation. Full light and dark theme parity.
